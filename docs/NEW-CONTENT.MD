# Content Framework & Finalized Content Strategy

---

## Part 1: Subsection Framework by Node Type

Based on the node types and their purposes, here's a standardized subsection schema. Not every node needs every subsection—apply only where relevant.

### Standard Subsections (Apply Selectively)

| Subsection | Use When | Appears In |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Links** | External resources exist (GitHub, Behance, etc.) | Artifacts, Research, Information |
| **Impact** | Measurable outcomes exist | Artifacts (product work especially) |
| **Stack** | Technical implementation details matter | Artifacts (AI Systems, XR Prototypes) |
| **Abstract** | Academic/research summary needed | Research nodes only |
| **Numbers** | Business metrics tell the story | Initiatives, Product Work artifacts |
| **Approach** | The "how" is interesting, not just "what" | Complex artifacts, Research |

### Type-Specific Defaults

| Node Type | Default Subsections | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Root** | *Currently*, *Looking for* | Frame present + intent |
| **Path** | Usually none—main content only | Paths are framing nodes; subsections clutter |
| **Artifact** | *Links*, *Impact* or *Stack* (where relevant) | Don't force both if one is thin |
| **Research** | *Abstract*, *Links* | Research nodes need rigor |
| **Initiative** | *Numbers*, main content covers post-mortem | Keep honest failure analysis in main |
| **Recognition** | None—main + extended sufficient | These are footnotes, keep light |
| **Information** | *Contact Me* for contact node | Utility nodes |

## Part 2: Node-by-Node Content

Format for each node:
- **Status**: Keep / Partial Rewrite / Full Rewrite
- **Main Content**: The primary description
- **Extended**: The "see more" expansion
- **Subsections**: With content where applicable

# ROOT

## Rudram Piplad

**Status:** Partial Rewrite (Extended needs work, add subsections)

### Main Content
> I build products that involve AI, and I think a lot about why most AI products feel broken.
>
> The short answer: they violate trust, hallucinate confidently, retrieve irrelevant context, optimize for metrics that don't align with user value... The systems work, technically. They just don't feel trustworthy.

**Extended**
> This problem isn't new. Before AI, I spent two years at insur-tech marketplace, 15M monthly users. Insurance, by definition, is a trust product sold through a trust-broken channel. People just don't engage with things they don't believe will work for them.

>I also spent time with VR Systems in research - how to render graphics in a way that respects human perception. That work taught me something I keep returning to: respect how humans actually experience things.

### Subsections

**Start**
>Just curious: Welcome. Click around the graph. Start with [[Photography]] maybe; that has the most life to it.  I think what I worked on [[AI Systems]] would interest if you want to see how I think about building."
>Hiring: I'm selectively exploring. I care about AI products that need to earn trust, not just engagement.
>To collaborate: Open to interesting problems in Product Strategy, AI systems, perception-aware interfaces, or... Photography.

# INFORMATION BRANCH

## Information (path)

**Status:** Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> The basics: where I studied, how to reach me, and a few achievements I'm told I should mention. The interesting stuff is elsewhere in the graph—this is the metadata.

### Subsections

**Contact Me**

**Education**
> IIM Bangalore — MBA, QS World Rank #31
> IIT Madras — BTech + MTech, Engineering Design (Biomedical)

---

## Education (path)

**Status:** Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Five years of engineering at IIT Madras, then two years of business school at IIM Bangalore. The first taught me how to build things; the second taught me how to decide what's worth building.

*(No subsections—children nodes carry the detail)*

---

## IIT Madras (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> 5 years. BTech + MTech in Engineering Design with a specialization in Biomedical Design. This is where I learned to build things—physical and digital.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Why engineering design instead of CS? Because I wanted to understand *how* things are made, not just *that* they work.

---

## Engineering Design (artifact)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> The department taught systems thinking before I knew that was a term. Products aren't features—they're systems of interactions. Users aren't data points—they're people with contexts and constraints. Most of my intuitions about product work trace back here.

### Extended
*[NEW]*
> The curriculum was weird in a good way: thermodynamics next to ergonomics next to rapid prototyping. You couldn't hide in abstraction. Eventually you had to make something real, and reality has opinions.

---

## Thesis: Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (research) ★

**Status:** Keep main, add Abstract subsection

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Masters thesis under Dr. N.J. Vasa (Dean, IIT Madras). Using laser-induced photoacoustic signals for biomedical sensing—shining light at tissue and listening to the sound it makes.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Learned how to work on a problem for 18 months without clear answers. How to design experiments that fail informatively. Research taught me patience and rigor.

### Subsections

**Abstract**
> Exhaled breath gas is a non-invasive matrix for disease monitoring. This study explores broadband photoacoustic spectroscopy using a low-power (1 nW) supercontinuum laser to analyze NH₃ in human breath samples. Achieved detection limits of 0.012 ppm in the 1500-1600 nm bandwidth. A hypothesized Michelson Interferometer arrangement was proposed for measuring phase change and refractive index shifts caused by photoacoustic absorption effects.

---

## IIM Bangalore (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> MBA, QS World Rank #31. Why an MBA after working as a PM? Because I hit a ceiling. I could ship products, but I couldn't shape strategy.

---

## MBA (artifact)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite (extend the Extended)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Two years of case studies, group projects, and questioning whether this was worth it. Verdict: yes, but not for the reasons I expected.

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> The value wasn't the curriculum—it was the cohort. 400 people from different industries, functions, countries. You learn how a supply chain manager thinks about risk, how a banker thinks about time, how a consultant thinks about structure. That cross-pollination changed how I frame problems.

---

## NCCU Exchange Taipei (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep, add connection to photography

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Exchange semester at National Chengchi University, Taiwan. FT MiM Rank #96. Curiosity about how tech ecosystems work outside Silicon Valley and Bangalore.

### Extended
*[PARTIAL REWRITE]*
> Taiwan builds hardware that the rest of the world's software runs on. Spent the semester asking: what if the constraint is the opportunity? Also took a lot of photographs—the city taught me to see differently. *(See: Taipei photography)*

---

## Contact Me (information)

**Status:** Keep (utility node)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Get in touch with me through any of these channels.

### Subsections

**Links**
> Email: rudram@alumni.iitm.ac.in
> LinkedIn · GitHub · Behance · Medium

---

## Footnotes (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> These aren't bragging rights. They're markers—moments where external validation confirmed (or surprised) me. Listed here for completeness, not prominence.

---

## HCL-CA TechJam (recognition) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Winner, 1 of 8,300 participants. Sydney. USD 3,000 prize. Funded by Cricket Australia and Microsoft.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> The lesson: hackathon wins are about scope management as much as technical skill.

---

## ITC Interrobang (recognition) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Runner-up, 2 of 600+ teams. Season 10. Pre-placement interview offer, ₹74,000 prize.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> An ideation challenge that taught me how to pitch. The winning idea wasn't my best idea—it was my most communicable idea.

---

## GATE & JEE Ranks (recognition)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> All India Rank 113, GATE Biomedical Engineering 2020. All India Rank 77 (category), JEE Main Paper 2, 2016.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Test scores. They opened doors. They don't define capability.

---

# AI SYSTEMS BRANCH

## AI Systems (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> I've spent the last two years building AI systems that need to work in production—not demos, not prototypes, actual products where wrong answers cost money or trust.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Most AI failures aren't capability failures, they're trust failures. This section is about RAG systems that actually retrieve relevant context, agents that know their boundaries, and evaluation frameworks that catch regressions before users do.

---

## RAG Pipelines (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> RAG is deceptively simple in theory: retrieve relevant chunks, feed them to an LLM, get better answers. In practice, every decision compounds.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built RAG systems at ThoughtSpot (enterprise scale) and in side projects. Lesson: naive RAG is easy to build and hard to trust.

---

## GraphRAG (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep, minor Extended addition

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Standard RAG felt like searching with a blindfold. Graph structures preserve relationships that chunking destroys.

### Extended
*[PARTIAL REWRITE]*
> Started from scratch twice. The first attempt over-engineered the graph construction; the second over-simplified retrieval. Key insight: the graph isn't just for retrieval—it's for explaining *why* an answer exists. That explainability changes how users trust outputs.

### Subsections

**Stack**
> Neo4j, LangChain, OpenAI

**Links**
> GitHub: graph-rag-trials

---

## Document Parsing (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Before you can chunk, you need to parse. And parsing is where documents lie to you. PDFs claim to have structure but hide text in random order.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built a parser pipeline using Docling that handles PDF, PPT, XLSX. Goal: predictable failure modes. When parsing fails, fail loudly.

### Subsections

**Stack**
> Docling, PyMuPDF, Unstructured, OCR

**Links**
> GitHub: document-parser-for-rag · doc-parsers

---

## Chunking Strategies (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> The dirty secret of RAG: your chunking strategy matters more than your embedding model. Chunk too small and you lose context. Chunk too large and you dilute relevance.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Tried recursive splitting, semantic chunking, parent-child hierarchies. Conclusion: hybrid approaches that preserve document structure outperform flat text processing.

### Subsections

**Links**
> GitHub: chunking-strategy-experiments

---

## AI Agents (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Agents are having a moment. Most of what I see is demos—impressive loops that work on happy paths and fail silently on edge cases.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built two agent systems. Both taught the same lesson: agents need escape hatches and introspection.

---

## Butler Expense Agent (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Travel expense tracking is annoying because it's contextual. A $50 meal might be business or personal depending on who you were with.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built a multi-agent system for categorization, policy checking, and anomaly detection. The interesting part: designing handoff protocols. Most agent demos show the happy path. The hard part is making the unhappy path graceful.

### Subsections

**Stack**
> LangGraph, GPT-4, Tool Calling

**Links**
> GitHub: butler-travel-expense-agent · expense-agents-ui-lovable

---

## AI Ethics Framework (research)

**Status:** Keep, add cross-reference

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Most AI ethics frameworks are checklists. Check boxes, ship product, feel good. That's not ethics—that's compliance theater.

### Extended
*[PARTIAL REWRITE]*
> Built a multi-agent evaluation system that asks hard questions about AI products—the uncomfortable ones about bias, autonomy, and unintended consequences. The hardest part: running this on my own projects and finding problems I didn't want to see. This work directly informed how I think about evaluation frameworks in production. *(See: Eval Framework)*

### Subsections

**Links**
> GitHub: applied-ai-ethics

---

## Safety & Evals (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Shipping AI without evals is shipping blind. The question isn't whether your model makes mistakes—it will. The question is whether you catch them before users do.

---

## Eval Framework (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep, add cross-reference

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> At ThoughtSpot, I introduced groundedness and safety evals as release gates. The rule: if evals regress, the release doesn't ship.

### Extended
*[PARTIAL REWRITE]*
> This was politically harder than technically hard. Engineers don't like gates. PMs don't like delays. But shipping regressions to production is worse. These evals now run on every release candidate for Boundaryless. *(See: Boundaryless / Enterprise Search)*

### Subsections

**Impact**
> nDCG@5 >0.7, Recall@10 >0.9, p95 latency <5s maintained across releases

---

## PII/DLP Guardrails (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Enterprise AI has a specific failure mode: leaking data that shouldn't be leaked. User asks a question, RAG retrieves a document they shouldn't see.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built PII redaction and DLP guardrails at ThoughtSpot. Cleared SOC 2 Type II with zero major findings. Design principle: guardrails should be invisible when working and loud when triggered.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> SOC 2 Type II certified, zero major audit findings

---

# SPATIAL & PERCEPTION BRANCH

## Spatial & Perception (path)

**Status:** Keep (this is excellent)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Before I cared about AI trust, I cared about perceptual honesty. VR systems that make you sick are lying to your vestibular system.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> This was my research focus at IIT Madras. It shapes how I think about all interfaces.

---

## Foveated Rendering & Gaze Tracking (research) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Human eyes have high resolution only at the fovea. Traditional rendering ignores this, computing every pixel at full resolution. Wasteful.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built a saccadic foveated rendering pipeline for VR using HTC Vive Pro Eye. Results: 57-70% compute reduction with no perceptible quality loss. Hard part: predicting where eyes would move next.

### Subsections

**Links**
> GitHub: foveated-rendering-virtual-reality

**Approach**
> Gaze tracking → saccade prediction → dynamic resolution allocation. The insight: you don't need to predict perfectly, you need to predict fast enough that errors self-correct.

---

## Haptics Research (research)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite (add bridge to product thinking)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Touch is the forgotten sense in computing. We've optimized visual fidelity for decades. Audio is good enough. But haptics? Still feels like vibration motors from 2010.

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> Built an evaluation matrix for XR haptic feedback (latency, comfort, thermal). Finding: +23% perceived responsiveness from optimizing feedback timing, not intensity. This taught me something that carries into product work: users often can't articulate what's wrong, but they feel it. The job is finding the latency they can't name.

---

## XR Prototypes (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> The best way to understand perception is to build things that break it. These prototypes were my lab at IIT Madras.

---

## AED in VR (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Built a VR training simulation for automated external defibrillator (AED) use. Goal: train people to respond to cardiac emergencies without physical equipment.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Learned more from failures than successes. Reverted all code at one point. What remained: understanding of how procedural memory works differently in VR.

### Subsections

**Stack**
> Unity, Oculus Quest

**Links**
> GitHub: automated-external-defibrillator-in-vr

---

## 3D Printing VR (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Can you design 3D-printable objects in VR more intuitively than in CAD software?

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Answer was nuanced. For ideation and rough shaping—yes, dramatically better. For precision work—no, CAD still wins. Interesting middle ground: start in VR to explore forms, export to CAD for refinement.

### Subsections

**Links**
> GitHub: 3d-printing-in-vr

---

## AR Mobile Games (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Built two location-based AR games using Unity and ARCore. One was a scavenger hunt mechanic; the other was a simple "catch" game with spawned objects. Both shipped to Play Store.

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> First-timer mistakes, documented. The games worked. The codebase didn't survive—I used Git locally but never pushed to remote. Lesson learned the hard way. What I did learn: mobile AR has brutal constraints. Battery drain, GPS drift, and the sun is your enemy. Designing for "works indoors in a demo" vs "works outdoors in direct sunlight" are completely different problems.

### Subsections

**Stack**
> ARCore, Unity, C#

---

## Visual Practice (path)

**Status:** Keep (this framing is important)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> I don't separate "creative" from "technical." Photography taught me about attention. Illustration taught me about abstraction. Design taught me about systems.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> This isn't a hobby section. It's a different lens on the same questions.

---

## Photography (artifact) ★

**Status:** Partial Rewrite (add specificity)

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Mostly street photography and travel documentation. I'm drawn to moments of transition—people between places, light between states, cities between old and new. The camera forces a question: what's worth keeping from this moment?

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> What draws me to certain subjects connects to my work on perception—where eyes go, what they ignore, what makes a moment register. Photography is attention training. It's also the only creative practice where I don't control the subject, only the frame.

---

## Taipei (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Photographs from my exchange semester at NCCU. Taipei layers history strangely—a temple next to a convenience store next to a construction site. The city doesn't hide its contradictions; it just keeps building around them.

*(No extended needed—let photos speak)*

---

## Bangalore (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> The city where I've lived longest but still don't fully understand. These photographs are mostly from early mornings—the only time Bangalore moves slowly enough to photograph.

---

## Graphic Design & Illustrations (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Design isn't decoration. It's communication with constraints. Every project here was about solving a problem visually.

---

## E-Cell Magazine (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Chief Designer for IIT Madras Entrepreneurship Cell. Led a team of 5+ designers, published the first entrepreneurship magazine at the institute.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> 30K+ copies printed. Design at scale is project management. The creative decisions were the easy part.

### Subsections

**Numbers**
> Team: 5+ designers · Circulation: 30K+ copies · First edition at IITM

---

## NFT Collection (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Minted 9+ digital art pieces on OpenSea during the Web3 wave. The art was real; the market was speculative.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Creating for a market is different from creating for yourself. The NFT work that sold wasn't my best work—it was my most marketable work.

### Subsections

**Links**
> OpenSea: rudrampiplad

---

## Behance Work (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> A collection of graphic work—branding explorations, poster designs, and a few illustrations that started as procrastination and became portfolio pieces. The strongest work here is a series of minimal movie posters where the constraint was "one visual element only."

### Subsections

**Links**
> Behance: roseate134

# PRODUCT WORK BRANCH

## Product Work (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> I've been a PM at two companies—Policybazaar (15M monthly users) and ThoughtSpot (enterprise BI). Different contexts, same job: figure out what actually matters, then make it happen.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Most product failures aren't feature failures. They're trust failures. Users don't engage because they don't believe the product will do what it promises.

---

## ThoughtSpot (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> ThoughtSpot is an AI-native BI platform. Users ask questions in natural language, the system generates queries, returns answers.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> AI in enterprise has different failure modes. Wrong answers lead to bad business decisions. A hallucinated number can cascade into a bad quarter.

---

## Boundaryless / Enterprise Search (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Enterprise data is scattered. Boundaryless is ThoughtSpot's answer: search across everything, get answers regardless of where data lives.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Shipped via rethink policy and aggressive caching. Evaluated vector DB vendors, negotiated SLAs, landed on hybrid approach saving ~25% on projected costs.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> <$0.004/query cost · >0.7 nDCG@5 · 0.9 Recall@10 · p95 latency <5s · ~25% cost savings vs initial projections

---

## Navigation & Discovery (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Enterprise tools accumulate objects—dashboards, reports, data sources, saved queries. ThoughtSpot had thousands. Users couldn't find what they were looking for, so they'd recreate things that already existed.

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> Overhauled the navigation system: standardized product list pages, rebuilt the search results UX, added contextual hints based on user role and history. The hard part wasn't the UI—it was aligning five teams on a shared information architecture. Result: 20% faster time-to-discovery in user studies.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> 20% faster time-to-discovery · Standardized list page components across product

---

## Object Search (artifact)

**Status:** Full Rewrite (was almost empty)

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Beyond answering questions, users need to find *things*—the dashboard their colleague mentioned, the report from last quarter, the data source they used once. Object search is different from answer search: you're not asking a question, you're hunting for something you half-remember.

### Extended
*[NEW]*
> Built semantic object search that weighs recency, access patterns, and object metadata. The challenge: balancing "what you've used before" against "what's actually relevant." Too much personalization and users get trapped in their own history.

---

## Homepage (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> The old homepage showed what you'd already seen, not what you needed next.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> New homepage surfaces relevant content based on behavior, role, and what's trending. Not personalization theater—actual signal-based recommendations with explainable logic.

---

## Policybazaar (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> India's largest insurance aggregator. 15M monthly users. Part of CEO's office, leading 7 agile teams on 3-year product strategy.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Insurance is confusing. Users don't know what they need. The job was making complexity manageable without dumbing it down.

---

## Your Orders (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Insurance customers buy a policy and forget about it. Every support call costs money.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Built "Your Orders" self-service portal. Saved ₹10M+ in support costs. 170% increase in engagement.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> ₹10M+ support costs saved · +170% engagement

---

## Web Analytics (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> When I joined, web analytics had 60% discrepancy between reported and actual numbers. Marketing was making decisions on fiction.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Formed team of 15+, overhauled analytics infrastructure. Cut discrepancies to <10%. Saved ₹6.5M+ in wasted spend.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> 60% → <10% discrepancy · ₹6.5M+ saved · Team of 15+ formed

---

## Growth & Mobile App (artifact)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Mobile app deployment was broken—releases took too long, adoption lagged. Streamlined the pipeline, got 50% adoption increase within two weeks. ₹25M+ attributed revenue.

### Extended
*[REWRITE]*
> Also ran A/B tests on upselling flows—21% higher conversion, ₹75M+ generated. The NLP work here is what got me interested in RAG: I prototyped an analysis system for support tickets to surface root causes. Cut turnaround by 40%. That prototype became the seed for later AI explorations. *(See: RAG Pipelines)*

### Subsections

**Impact**
> +50% app adoption · ₹25M+ mobile revenue · ₹75M+ from upselling · 40% TAT reduction on support tickets

---

## Consulting (path)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Consulting is a different muscle. You don't own the roadmap. You give recommendations and hope they stick.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> The value: pattern matching across companies. The limit: influence without authority.

---

## Tata Group (path)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Summer associate at TCS, CPG & Retail practice. Management consulting, not product management—strategy decks instead of PRDs, stakeholder alignment instead of sprint planning.

---

## MLOps & LLM Intelligence (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Authored competitive intelligence reports on MLOps platforms and LLM capabilities.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Proposed RFP template revisions targeting 12% cost savings. Finding: most RFPs over-specified requirements creating artificial vendor lock-in.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> 12% projected cost savings in revised RFPs

---

## AI Maturity Model (artifact)

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Built a three-part digital maturity model to assess enterprise AI readiness. Helped sales have AI conversations with CIOs.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Most enterprises want to "do AI" but can't articulate what that means. The model gave them vocabulary.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> +15% AI adoption in CIO proposals

---

## Chisel Labs (path)

**Status:** Partial Rewrite

### Main Content
*[REWRITE]*
> Product consulting for a pre-Series A SaaS startup. Paid engagement, not advisory equity—actual deliverables with deadlines.

---

## Global SaaS GTM (artifact) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Designed go-to-market strategy for international expansion. Built post-trial conversion playbook.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Focused on activation metrics—getting trial users to the "aha moment" faster. Forecasted 20% ARR uplift.

### Subsections

**Impact**
> 20% ARR uplift forecasted

---

# BETS BRANCH

## Bets (path)

**Status:** Keep (excellent as-is)

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Bets are different from jobs. You don't have product-market fit handed to you. You have an idea and the willingness to be wrong publicly.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> I've made two bets. One worked (sort of). One didn't (but taught me more).

---

## Caval (initiative) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Vehicle servicing is broken. You don't know if you're being overcharged. You trust mechanics because you have no choice.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Co-founded Caval. Transparent pricing, tracked service history, user ratings. ₹5L revenue, 4K+ users, 4.6 Play Store rating. I led design. What didn't work: unit economics at scale. CAC too high for transaction value.

### Subsections

**Numbers**
> ₹5 Lakh revenue · 4K+ users · 4.6 Play Store rating · Role: Co-founder, Design Lead

---

## EventHive (initiative) ★

**Status:** Keep

### Main Content
*[KEEP]*
> Event hosting platforms are either too simple (Google Forms) or too complex (6-month enterprise implementations). EventHive was the middle ground.

### Extended
*[KEEP]*
> Co-founded at IIT Madras. Built ticketing, attendee management, check-in systems. Raised ₹30L. What didn't work: timing. Built as event market was recovering post-COVID.
