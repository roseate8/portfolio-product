  "description": "<p>I build products that involve AI, and I think a lot about why most AI products feel broken.</p><p>The short answer: they violate trust. They hallucinate confidently. They retrieve irrelevant context. They optimize for metrics that don't align with user value. The systems work, technically. They just don't feel trustworthy.</p><p>This problem isn't new to me. Before AI, I worked on VR systems—specifically, how to render graphics in a way that respects human perception. Your eyes don't see uniformly; why should rendering be uniform? That work taught me something I keep returning to: the best systems aren't the most powerful ones. They're the ones that respect how humans actually experience them.</p>",
  "extendedDescription": "<p>Right now, I'm a PM at ThoughtSpot, building AI-powered enterprise search. Before that, I led product at Policybazaar for 15M monthly users. I've started two companies, done some consulting, and maintained a visual practice that I take seriously—photography and digital art aren't hobbies, they're how I stay calibrated on what \"seeing clearly\" actually means.</p><p>I studied engineering design at IIT Madras (five years, BTech + MTech) and got an MBA at IIM Bangalore. The combination lets me go deep on technical problems while still connecting them to business outcomes—but more importantly, it taught me to think in systems, not features.</p><p>This portfolio is a graph. It's meant to be explored, not read linearly. Start anywhere.</p>",

Transparent pricing, tracked service history, user ratings. Results: ₹5L revenue, 4K+ users, 4.6 rating on Play Store. I led design — the app, the UX, the visual identity. What worked: the user need was real. What didn't: unit economics at scale. Customer acquisition cost was too high for the transaction value. We couldn't make the math work without raising more than we wanted to. Lesson: Good products can be bad businesses. And that's okay to learn.</p>",

We could have waited it out, but waiting costs money and momentum.</p><p>The lesson isn't \"timing is everything\"—that's too easy.
